# Recognition and learning body lenguage system.

### Description: 

The script developed [Recognition_And_Learning_Body_Lenguage.py](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/blob/master/Complet%20Project/Recognition_And_Learning_BodyLenguage_System.py) works using the GUI created **Recognition_And_Learning_Body_LenguagueGUI.ui** to perform the interaction with the [Robot Pepper](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/pepper). The idea of this system is that the humans can increase the confiance with the humanoids robots, throught the comprehension of the human's body lenguage by the robots, of this way the robots will interact in a coherent form with the human mood. This interaction is carried out using verbal and notverbal lenguage. 

The key of the system is the feature that allow of it understand the mood of the humans throught the body lenguage. This is possible implementing a [Neural network model](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/tree/master/Nueral%20Networks/Classify%20emotions) which was buiilt to classify the body lenguage in six categories, recognizing if the person is: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Relfexive or in a Normal state. The data used by the NNA is gotten using the **Microsoft Kinect V2 Camera** which allow compute the skeleton tracking and calcule the spatial ubication and the orientation of the body joints, with the orientation expressed like eulerian angles **(Yaw, Roll, Pitch)** from the head, shoulders, elbows, wrist, waist, hips and knees; and also the state of the hands **(close or open)** are gotten 23 values which are the input of the NNA.

After of the human mood is recognize, the system send a speech and a motion sequence (behavior animation), coherent with the emotion that the person is expresing with his body, to be spoken and played by the robot, of this way the robot interact with the humans having with base their mood. 

Also, the system allow to have conversation with the robot using the speech recognition system which catch the audio data and transform it into a text string. This string is used like the input a of [Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM)](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), which is a special kind of [Recurrent neural networks (RNN)](http://www.felixgers.de/papers/phd.pdf), capable of learning long-term dependencies, used to generate answers to the user's speech and then to make that the robot spoken the answers. Complementing the message spoken, the robot also perform a motion sequence (behavior animation) with its body in coherent way with the speech. 

The system developed has three more functions, one of them allow to the user to play to be imitated by the robot. All the body moves that the user makes in front the Kinect camera, will be copied by the robot. Another function must to be taken as game in which the user perform a motion sequence and the robot reproduce a complet different motion sequence (generated by the [Generative Adversarial Network model](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/tree/master/Nueral%20Networks/Create%20Motion%20Sequences)) showing how will be the user's moves in an "Alternative world". Finally the system allow create new motion sequences (behavior animations), throught the imitation technique, to increase the motion sequences that could be reproduce by the robot.

### RNA models used:

The ANN built to perform the recognition of the emotions using the body posture data, is a two hidden layers network that has 23 inputs and 6 ouputs that generate a codification to each emotion class designated.

* The image is a representation of the neural network built.

The LSTM were introduced by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory), the LSTM, like all RNN, have the form of a chain of repeating modules of a neural network; but the difference with the regulars RNN is that this newtworks have reapeting modules with a very simple structure (a single tanh layer); and the LSTM has a reapting module with a different structure, in fact there are four neural network layers interacting in a very special way.

* The image illustrates the repeating module of a normal RNN and the LSTM network.

The LSTM model used to introduce the conversation option was inspired in the [Neural conversation model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869v3.pdf) which is caracterize by use one sequence to get another sequence, seq2seq, this model was built using the [Chatterbot wrapper](http://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), disponible to python, which is a library that makes easier generate automates responses to string inputs using a selectrion of machine learning algorithms, including RNN and LSTM models, to produce different types of responses. 

* The image represents the LSTM model implemented with the Chatterbot tool.

The GAN model used to created "originals" motion sequences, in fact is a joint work of two neural networks, the first of them create new data, using deconvolutional layers, from a ramdon numerics value, and the second compare this data with the original, data presented by the user in the training, to decide which is real and which is fake; using convolutional layers. Epoch by epoch the first neural network goes increasing the perform of the data created with the feedback of the second network.

* Beacause the previous explanation, the lines 181-187 of the same Wrapper: [Neural_Networks_Models.py](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/blob/master/Complet%20Project/Wrappers/Neural_Networks_Models.py#L37-L38) are used to load the data base of the motion sequences created using the GAN model (you can found it in this repository in the folder: [Create motion sequences](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/tree/master/Nueral%20Networks/Create%20Motion%20Sequences) and is recommended first run this script to generate the motion sequences), selecting one of them at the time in a random form. This is used to perform the Pepper's behavior in the "Alternative world" function. The logic to select and import the motion sequences follow the current explanation: is select a random epoch, 1 to 300, and then is selectec a random motion sequence, 1 to 32 (the author trained the GAN model by 300 epochs and save all the data generated, in each epoch are generated 32 motion sequences). Finally are loaded the file with the structure: "NewAnimation Epoch-Motion sequence"; example: "NewAnimation 100-32".

**Please, if you generate a different number of motion sequences with the GAN model, change the randoms and valitations values.**
**Please make shure that the path to load the file is correct.

```

* To create a new corpus data in the chatterbot library, is necessary go to the chatterbot_corpus folder and then into the data folder (installed if you use Anaconda in: **C:\...\Anaconda2_Win32\Lib\site-packages\chatterbot_corpus\data**) and create a new folder with the name "Pepper_Speech" (this was the name used by the author to create the folder in which was saved the corpus with the dialogues of the Conversation with Pepper) **Is important that if you select a different name, change the corpus name selector in the line 56 of the wrapper: [Neural_Networks_Models.py](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/blob/master/Complet%20Project/Wrappers/Neural_Networks_Models.py#L37-L38) **), and then create a file with the name **"myown.yml"** (you can open this file with any text editor) and paste the dialogues: [Conversation with Pepper.txt](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/blob/master/Emotions%20Recognition/Conversation%20with%20Pepper.txt).

```python
    49      # Is configured a ChatBot model that allow get answers to pre-define questions.         
    50      self. PepperSay = ChatBot('Pepper Answers',

```

* To make that the robot Pepper perform a specific behavior with its speech, is used a second LSTM model created with the chatterbot tool, which its input is the answer generated by the first one, and their output is the tag with the name of the motion sequence that the robot goes to reproduce. This model must to be configurated in the same form that the previous, creating a folder in the corpus folder with the name "Pepper_Speech_Animation" **(Remind if you select a different name, you have to check the name in the line 62 of the wrapper: [Neural_Networks_Models.py](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/blob/master/Complet%20Project/Wrappers/Neural_Networks_Models.py#L37-L38))**, and then create a file with the name **"myown.yml"** and paste the dialogues: [Tags to play motion sequences in conversations.txt](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/blob/master/Complet%20Project/Data_And_RNA_Models/Tags%20to%20play%20motion%20sequences%20in%20conversations.txt)
